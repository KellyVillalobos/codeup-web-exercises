/*
3 types of selectors
1. element (tag name like section, main, or footer)
2. class (start with a . and are tied to class="" in html) more important than elements
3. id (most important ones) they start with a # and start with a # in css

multiple selectors are written h1, .fancy-header{} (seperate them with a comma)


Open up your welcome.html file from earlier.
