                    <li><strong>PARTIES:</strong> The parties to this lease are:</li>
                    <li><strong>PROPERTY</strong> Landlord leases to Tenant the following real property:</li>
                    <li><strong>TERM:</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>AUTOMATIC RENEWAL AND NOTICE OF TERMINATION:</strong> This lease automatically renews on a month
                        to month basic unless Landlord or Tenant provides the other party written notice of termination as provided
                        in paragraph 4A. Oral notice of termination is not sufficient under any circumstances. Time is of the essence
                    for providing notice of termination (strict compliance with dates by which notice must be provided is required).
                    The date on which rent is due does not apply to the requirement for providing written notice of termination. If a
                    a box is not checked under Paragraph 4A, Paragraph 4A(1) will apply. If a box not checked under Paragraph 4B,
                    Paragraph 4B(1) will apply.</li>
