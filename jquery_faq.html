    <dt>What is the origin of the National Park Service arrowhead?</dt>
    <dd class="invisible">
        The arrowhead was authorized as the official National Park Service emblem by the Secretary of the Interior on
        July 20, 1951. The components of the arrowhead may have been inspired by key attributes of the National Park
        System, with the sequoia tree and bison representing vegetation and wildlife, the mountains and water
        representing scenic and recreational values, and the arrowhead itself representing historical and archeological
        values. Read more about the history of the arrowhead and other elements of NPS visual design.

        The NPS allows limited use of the NPS arrowhead when doing so contributes to our work. Learn how to request
